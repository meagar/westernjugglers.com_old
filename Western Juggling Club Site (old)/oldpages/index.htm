<font size=5>Our Mission Statement:<br></font>
<font size=3>The purpose of the Western Juggling Club is to promote a sense of community and fun through the art of juggling.  This is done within the University, as well as within the Community.  We have the goal of providing juggling information and support to fellow jugglers (and the general public) through inspiration, communication, and cooperation.<br><br></font>

<font size=5>Translation:<br></font>
<font size=4>Basically.. we have fun, juggle, play games, talk, and eat pizza.  Who could ask for more?<br><br><br></font>

<font size=5>About Us:<br></font>
<font size=3>Our membership roster has always included a wide spectrum of skill levels, from raw beginners to professionals.  Think you can't learn... well you can.  In just one meeting we'll have you juggling to amaze your friends, and after a few weeks, you'll be juggling like a pro.  Many of our current members came to their first meeting not knowing how to juggle.  You should be able to find someone to match your skill level without trouble, and there are always folks willing to share their secrets of the trade.  Apart from a small membership fee for the academic year everything else is free.  We have our own juggling equipment which we can lend to you if you want to learn so don't worry about having to splash out on new stuff, use ours.  If you are interested in buying your own stuff, juggling equipment vendors such as True Canadian Balls do drop buy for a visit with their wares.<br><br></font>

<font size=5>Translation:<br></font>
<font size=4>We are always more than happy to teach <I>anybody</I> the basics of juggling!  Just show up and check it out!<br></font>
