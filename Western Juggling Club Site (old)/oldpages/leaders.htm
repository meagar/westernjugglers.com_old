<font size=4>Hey there!  My name is Ryan Marttala.  Somehow, some very misguided people let me become of the "leader" of this outfit! (Not that I'm complaining!)  Before I first joined the club, I couldn't even throw a ball, let alone catch one.  It's amazing what a little practice can do!  As for me, I'm an upper-year music student studying composition.  I keep busy by doing this (juggling), my homework, foot patrol, choir directing, playing piano, and WUFS.  I DO enjoy being busy!  My fav ice cream would have to be the "Beam Me Up Scotty" Sundae. (Not kidding!)<br><brclear="left"></font>

<font size=4>Hi, I'm Peter "Pete" Cavell, the VP Finance.  I'm a third-year music student, a two-time music soph, and involved with the Improv Club (WiiiA), CHRW radio, and the campus tour guide service.  Throughout my tedious and exemplary childhood, I tried to teach myself to juggle many many times, with no success.  I felt myself to be a failure in every possible way.  But within two weeks of joining the UWO Juggling Club, I was cascading like crazy!  My floor in res even voted me "Most Likely to Run Off to the Circus".

<font size=4>Hi, my name is Stephanie Savidant.  I'm the VP communications this year.  I'm a third year geology student and I've been a member of the juggling club since my first year here.  I've started juggling in grade 9 and joined the circus in grade 11 (...well maybe not but it would make a great story!)  My favourite flavour of ice cream is mint chocolate chip (wink, wink, nudge, nudge, say no more, say no more).  Anyways, I really encourage you to come out whether you already juggle or just have juggle envy.<br><brclear="left"></font>
