    Hey guys, last year I couldn't juggle at all and this year I can juggle 5 balls.
    <p>
    One of the reasons I truly enjoy juggling is because I find it to be very relaxing and 
    a fun break from studying on those late nights. Away from this club you'll find me training 
    hard for triathalons and studying like crazy. Last year I had tons of fun in this club and 
    I will ensure that everyone who joins the club for fun and good times will not be dissapointed.

    Besides juggling, I also breakdance, do gymnastics, tramoplining, and martial arts. I can also roll 
    my tummy if anyone wants to see. I'm a big nerd and play all sorts of card games, board games, 
    and video games. I also think that philosophy should be a compulsory course for everyone at some level.
