    <b> <u>F.A.Q. </u>
<p>
Q: What is the Western Juggling Club?
<p>
A:</b> The Western Juggling Club is, generally, a group of people who share some interest in juggling regardless of their experience. We usually meet biweekly on Sunday nights at 7:00 PM. Anyone interested in juggling is welcome to visit and check out our club, a membership fee is required for club equipment, room rental, and miscellaneous club expenses (usually including pizza). Members from outside of the University of Western Ontario are allowed, although one must be a current UWO student in order to officially be a part of the executive. We have a number of non-Western members; some of whom come from Fanshawe College, and some are London dwellers who enjoy the art of juggling. In 2002 - 2003, meetings typically consisted of open juggling and occasional combat juggling [see: What is combat juggling?]; however, suggestions as to possible activities or events are always welcome and will be greatly appreciated. In the Autumn, we usually have a representative from Higgens Brothers come and sell juggling balls, clubs, diabolos and other juggling equipment.

<b>Q: What is Juggling?
<p>
A:</b> 	Merriam-Webster's definition:									
<p>	
Main Entry: 1jug·gle<br>									 	
Function: verb <br>											
Inflected Form(s): jug·gled; jug·gling<br> 									
Etymology: Middle English jogelen, from Middle French jogler to joke,<br> 
from Latin joculari, from joculus, diminutive of jocus joke <br>					
Date: 15th century <br>										
intransitive senses <br>										
1 : to perform the tricks of a juggler <br>
2 : to engage in manipulation especially in order to achieve a desired end<br>
<p>
The Western Juggling Club's Definition:<br>
<p>
'Juggling' is generally the art of manipulating an object or objects. We do not limit our club to throwing
and catching balls, clubs and the like. We have had members and visitors share their knowledge on:<br>
<p>
-Yo-Yos<br>	
-Diabolos<br>
-Devil Sticks<br>	
-Unicyles<br>
<p>
Juggling is pretty much just playing around with challenging, brightly-coloured toys (props) or everyday 
objects. We encourage anyone to come to a meeting and teach others, or learn, about anything remotely 
related to juggling.
<p>
<b>Q: What is Combat Juggling?
<p>
A:</b> Combat Juggling is a group activity for those able to juggle three balls. The basic rules are simple: <br>
(1) Everyone starts to juggle at once.<br>
(2) If you are unable to keep juggling three balls (this can be because of dropping or another player taking a ball while 
you are juggling), or you exit the predetermined perimeter, you are out. <br>
(3) The last person juggling three balls wins, and gets to start the next round.
<p>
<u>Western's Very Own Version!!! (great for beginning jugglers):</u><br>
<p>
This version of combat juggling has one rule change: (2 - revised) If you are unable to keep juggling three balls, you must 
either <br>
(a) stay where you were eliminated, and your feet must not move OR <br>
(b) move outside of the predetermined perimeter where you may move around freely.
<p>
While you are still unable to be the last person juggling, you may still participate by using your 
hands to distract or eliminate the juggling competitors. This version allows novice jugglers to participate and practice 
offensive maneuvers rather than being forced to watch on the side-lines due to their lack of juggling experience.
<p>
<p>
<b>Q: What other things are you required to tell me?
<p>
A:</b> USC requires the Western Juggling Club to state that the Western Juggling Club is not an agent or representative of the 
USC and that our views and actions in no way represent the USC.
