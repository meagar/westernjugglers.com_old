<p>
	<b>The Western Juggling Club</b> is a student club at the
	<a href="uwo.ca">University of Western Ontario</a> that promotes
	juggling as a fun, stress-relieving activity that helps to improve
	hand-eye coordination.  The club is suitable for jugglers of all
	skill levels, with learn-to-juggle workshops for those just starting
	out, and juggling games for those with a little more experience.
</p>

<p>
	For those looking to buy juggling props of their own, we will have
	a representative from Higgins Brothers juggling equipment out to one
	of our fall meetings with various props for sale.  Otherwise, the
	club has a collection of equipment that can be used at our meetings
	and eventually signed out on a weekly basis by our members.
</p>

<p>
	Juggling is not just done with
	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balls_(juggling)">balls</a>,
	and we have members who juggle a wide variety of other props including
	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clubs_(juggling)">clubs</a>,
	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juggling_ring">rings</a>,
	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devil_Sticks">devil sticks</a>,
	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabolo">diabolos</a>,
	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cigar_box_%28juggling%29">cigar boxes</a>,
	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendama">kendama</a>, and
	<a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yo-yo">yo-yos</a>.  They would be more than
	happy to demonstrate how to use all of these props as well as how to
	perform tricks with them.
</p>

<p>
	The club meets weekly throughout the school year, alternating between
	Sundays in Room 15 of Alumni Hall, and Mondays in the atrium of UCC,
	from 7 - 9 p.m.  A <?= meetings_link('full schedule') ?> is available.
