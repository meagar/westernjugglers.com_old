		, 'Turbo418 is a 3 day festival at the Quebec Circus school.  This year\'s special guest will be Thomas Dietz, and you do <em>not</em> want to miss it.  There will be at least one car travelling from London with seats available, contact Matt or Sean to reserve a spot.  Absolutly worth the 10 to 11 hour drive.  Sleeping space is provided, tickets are $35 for the entire weekend (if you purchase online before Jan 8th) or $40 at the door.  Don\'t miss this festival!'
