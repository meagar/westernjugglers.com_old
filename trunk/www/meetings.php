<h3>Room 15 - Alumni Hall</h3>

Room 15 in Alumni Hall is also known as the wrestling room.  It is downstairs in Alumni Hall and can be reached by entering Alumni Hall through the front entrance and following the hall to the left.  Go down the stairs and follow the hallway to Room 15.   Shoes must be removed as the floor is padded with wrestling mats.

<h3>UCC Atrium</h3>
<p>
Meetings are held in the atrium of UCC near the entrance to the Spoke.  Parking on campus on Monday nights will require you to pay for parking.  Most meters on campus are in effect until 8 p.m. on weekdays.  If available, the best option is to park in the lot beside Weldon library which has a $4 coin entry in the evenings.
